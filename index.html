                            Steins;Gate is a Japanese visual novel developed by 5pb. and Nitroplus. It is the second
                            game in
                            the Science Adventure series following Chaos;Head. The game is described by the development
                            team
                            as a "hypothetical science ADV" and explores time and time travel in 2010 Akihabara. The
                            gameplay follows non-linear plot lines which offer branching scenarios with courses of
                            interaction.

                            Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures
                            called Titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes
                            these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger
                            but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity
                            began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single
                            titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal Titan manages
                            to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against
                            the man-eating abominations.
